## Race Conditions in Websockets 

In the field of information technology, ensuring data reliability and integrity is crucial, especially with millions of users and terabytes of data in the mix. However, as software systems become more complex, issues such as race conditions can arise, significantly impacting system operation and leading to unpredictable outcomes.

### What are race conditions?

Race conditions, also referred to as state races, are errors that occur in multitasking programs when two or more threads or processes attempt to modify shared data or resources simultaneously without synchronization. This can result in unexpected and unpredictable outcomes since the order of execution of operations depends on which threads or processes finish first. Detecting race conditions is a challenging issue in software systems due to their unpredictable nature.

While there are numerous resources available about classic race conditions on the internet, this article explores whether race conditions can occur in WebSockets.

### WebSockets: Real-Time Bidirectional Connections

WebSockets are a cutting-edge technology that significantly improves interaction in web applications by providing an open bidirectional connection between a user's web browser and a web server. This seamless connection enables data exchange without the need for constantly initiating new HTTP requests, making them ideal for creating interactive applications.

### Advantages of WebSockets:

1. Low Latency: WebSockets minimize data exchange delays, making them an excellent choice for applications where real-time matters, such as online games or chat applications.
2. Resource Efficiency: WebSockets support a persistent connection, reducing the overhead associated with establishing and tearing down connections compared to numerous consecutive HTTP requests.
3. Bidirectional Data Exchange: Both the client and server can send data to each other without waiting for a request, making WebSockets an excellent tool for creating interactive web applications.
4. Compatibility: WebSockets can be used in various programming languages and technologies, making them a universal tool for creating interactive web applications.

To demonstrate the concept, this article includes a Java code that represents a WebSocket server that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. The server uses the Java-WebSocket library to handle WebSocket connections and performs the following tasks:

1. After launching the program, the Java code connects to the database and checks if the "example" table exists. If it doesn't exist, it creates the table and inserts random data:
   - RandomName0
   - RandomName1
   - ...
   - RandomName9

2. The most interesting code is found in the "onMessage" function. 
```java
public static int a = 0;

@Override
public void onMessage(WebSocket conn, String message) {
    if (a == 0) {
        try {
            // some activity with db
            int rowCount = getCountFromExampleTable();

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error executing query: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        conn.send("Echo: " + message);
        a = a + 1;
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}

```
There's a global variable "id" initialized to 0. When a client connects to the server and sends a message, it checks if "id == 0", indicating whether this function has already been executed. If not, a simple SQL command is executed to select the count of rows from the "example" table. Then, "id" is incremented by 1, and its value is printed. And in theory, the function should not be executed 2 times. 

In regards to the client, two types of clients have been created: "WebSocketParallel_Success"

. Attempts have been made to create a race condition using two different methods. In the first file, multiple connections are created in parallel, and data is sent to the server, while in the second file, only one connection is established, but data is sent one after the other. 

As evident from the class names, if multiple connections are created in parallel and data is sent, the race condition will occur. However, it won't occur in the second case since WebSockets transmit data sequentially in a single connection.

As shown in the screenshots below, race conditions can occur.

### Are there any race condition vulnerabilities in WebSockets in the wild?

Yes, a few critical race condition vulnerabilities have been detected in some cryptocurrency exchanges. These issues have been reported, and the exchanges subsequently fixed them.
